# Organization conventions

Mandatory for every repository in `ailuracollective`. Each
repository keeps a copy at
`.agents/organization-conventions.md`, and its `AGENTS.md` links
here instead of restating any of it.

These are the rules shared across repositories. A repository's
own language, layout, build and test commands are not here; they
belong in its `AGENTS.md`. A repository that departs from a rule
below records the departure in its `AGENTS.md`, with the reason
it was taken. An exception nobody wrote down is not an
exception.

## The standard is copied by hand

The shared standard originates in `ailuracollective/standards`
and is copied into each repository's `.github/`:

- `.github/ISSUE_STANDARD.md` — how an issue is written.
- `.github/labels.yml` — the label manifest.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — the issue forms.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` — the pull-request forms.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — who reviews what.

Copy this file to `.agents/organization-conventions.md`, and
`templates/AGENTS.md` from the origin to the repository root as
`AGENTS.md`.

There is no sync mechanism. Editing the origin changes nothing
elsewhere, and copies drift by default. A change to a shared
artifact is finished only when it has been mirrored into every
adopting repository by hand.

## Issues

Issues follow `.github/ISSUE_STANDARD.md` — its types and title
convention, its core sections, and its writing principles — and
are opened through the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
The standard's `config.yml` disables blank issues.

- One type per issue, matching the template's `title:` prefix.
- Every template applies `status/needs-review` itself, so an
  issue is never briefly unlabelled.
- Name only labels declared in `.github/labels.yml`. GitHub
  drops an unknown label silently, without an error.

## Pull requests

- Titles follow Conventional Commits. The allowed types are the
  filenames of `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`, minus the
  default form.
- Branches are `<github-username>/<type>/<description>`, all
  lowercase. The type is the title type, except
  `breaking-change`, which is a commit marker and not a branch
  type.
- The body follows the template for the title's type. Common
  headings are: `## Linked issue`, `## Summary`, `## Changes`,
  `## Verification`, `## Risk / compatibility` (optional),
  `## Migration` (optional).
- Link the issue with a closing keyword (`Closes #N`); the issue
  must carry `status/ready`.
- Apply exactly one `type/*` label. The title type and the label
  differ: several title types share a label.
- `## Verification` asks for evidence, not commands. Do not name
  commands CI already runs.
- Update documentation where public behavior or configuration
  changed.
- All CI checks pass.

## Labels

`.github/labels.yml` is the manifest. It is a record, not
configuration: GitHub does not read it, and editing it changes
no remote.

- Six families: `type/`, `status/`, `scope/`, `meta/`,
  `github_actions`, and `release/`.
- `type/` is frozen at five members. A repository-specific
  concern uses an existing `type/*` label plus an `extensions`
  entry in its customization record; it does not add a `type/*`
  label.
- Never name a label the manifest does not declare.

## Commits

Conventional Commits. The type is not decoration: the
pull-request title check reads it, and the body check resolves
the template from it.

## Review

Changes land through a pull request, not a direct push to the
default branch. `.github/CODEOWNERS` assigns reviewers.

- The **last** matching pattern wins; ownership is not additive.
- Keep a catch-all rule: an unowned path skips the code-owner
  gate.
- CODEOWNERS binds only through branch protection or rulesets.
  GitHub silently skips a line it cannot parse and an owner
  without write access.
- Configured is not enforced. Verify against the specific
  repository and branch through the GitHub API before calling a
  rule binding.

## Customization

A repository that changes nothing is an exact copy. To deviate,
copy `.github/standards.local.example.yml` to
`.github/standards.local.yml` and declare each change. A
`reason` is required on every override, drop and structural
entry; a level-3 deviation also records the issue that approved
it. The example file's header is the reference for the sections.

- It declares; it does not configure. No workflow reads it,
  including the gate.

## Documentation

- A change to public behavior or configuration updates the
  documentation in the same change.
- A generated changelog is not edited by hand.
- What "documented" means for a repository — a comment, a
  docstring, a page, a changelog entry — is declared in its
  `AGENTS.md`.

## Agent instructions

- An agent that opens a pull request opens it as a draft.
- Every repository has an `AGENTS.md` at its root. Agents read
  the nearest one above the file they are editing; the deeper
  file wins for the paths it covers.
- `AGENTS.md` links these conventions and does not restate them.
  If a rule is not in this file, it is not an organisation rule.
- Repository-specific rules, and every departure from these
  conventions, are recorded in `AGENTS.md` with a reason.

## Security and workflows

- Workflow permissions are minimal: each job declares only what
  it needs.
- A workflow that executes code from a pull-request head never
  receives secrets, and a policy check does not execute the code
  under review.
- Every workflow job sets `timeout-minutes`.
- Checkout sets `persist-credentials: false` unless credentials
  are required.
